### Introduction:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An instrument is a device in which we can determine the magnitude or value of the quantity to be measured under observation. The measuring quantity can be voltage, current, power and energy etc. <br>

Electrical systems must be tested for proper operation when they are installed and also periodically for maintenance purposes. The use of electronic test equipment test instruments and meters generally involves. <br>

1. Troubleshooting electrical/electronic circuits and equipment. <br>

2. Verifying proper operation of instruments and associated equipment. <br>

Now a days, there are two types of instruments available  <br>

1. Analog instruments <br>

2. Digital instruments<br><br>

### Analog Instruments:
In analog instruments measure of quantity has been taken as the position of moving pointer on a dial/scale. In these instruments possibilities of human error exists and its possible accuracy is approx. 0.25%.<br><br>

If exact reading is required operator takes more time to guess the approximate tenths of small division. <br>

An analog instrument is one in which the output or display is a continuous function of time and bears a constant relation to its input. <br>

The analog instruments ﬁnd extensive use in present-day applications although digital instruments are increasing in number and applications. <br>

The areas of application which are common to both analog and digital instruments are fairly limited at present.<br>

Hence, it can safely be predicted that the analog instruments will remain in extensive use for a number of years and are not likely to be completely replaced by digital instruments for certain applications. <br>


#### Digital Instruments:
In digital instruments measure of quantity has been taken as a number. In these type of instruments human error doesn’t exist and its possible accuracy is 0.005%. <br>

Its time to observed reading is very fast. These instruments are calibrated internally with the help of an internal standard stabilized source. <br>

Due to several advantages of digital instruments such as high speed, errorless results, better resolution and greater accuracy over analog instruments, the popularity of digital instruments are increasing rapidly. <br>

Quantization is the basis of working of a digital instrument. It is an act of transforming an analog signal into its digital form. Digital instruments are composed of logic circuits that carry out measurement of the quantities. <br>

Basically there are three type of measuring instruments and they are: <br>

1. Electrical measuring instrument<br>
2. Mechanical measuring instrument<br>
3. Electronic measuring instrument<br>

Here we are interested in electrical measuring instrument. <br>

#### Characteristics of instrument: <br>

1. Accuracy: It is desirable quality in measurement. It is defined as the degree of the closeness with which instrument reading approaches the true value of the quantity being measured. <br>

2. Sensitivity: It is also desirable quality in the measurement. It is defined as the ratio of the magnitude response of the output signal to the magnitude response of the input signal.<br>

3. Reproducibility: It is again a desirable quality. It is defined as the degree of the closeness with which a given quantity may be repeatedly measured. High value of reproducibility means low value of drift. <br>

#### List of electrical instruments:

1. Ammeter <br>

2. Voltmeter <br>

3. Wattmeter <br>

4. Transformer <br>

5. Electric motor  <br>
