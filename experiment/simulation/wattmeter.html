              <!--   style="font-size: 18px;">--> <p> A wattmeter is a device that measure power, or the amount of energy
                    being used, in a given space or system. In short it is used to measure
                    active electric power. </p>
                <p> There are two coils in wattmeter. <br>
                    1. Current coil <br>
                    2. Potential coil
                </p>
                <p>Current coil is fixed coil and potential coil is movable coil</p>
                <p>When the wattmeter is connected in the circuit to measure the power, the current coil carries load
                    current and potential coil carries current proportional to the load voltage, due to currents in the
                    coils, mechanical force exist between them. The result is that movable coil moves the pointer over
                    the the scale. The pointer comes to reset at a position where deflecting torque </p>
                <p>Deflecting torque T<sub>D</sub> is directly proportional to load power</p>
                <p> It is a helpful device for comparing the power use
                    of different systems, such as lamps and computers, and for measuring the
                    power of systems that operate at power levels too low to be measured by
                    other instruments. Wattmeter are used in the field of energy efficiency
                    to measure the energy efficiency of building, appliances and other
                    systems.</p>
                <p>The working mechanism of a wattmeter is based on the principle that
                    the amount of electricity consumed by an appliance is proportional to
                    the power consumed by the appliance. Thus, an appliance that consumes
                    more electricity will use more energy than a similar-sized appliance.
                    The formula used for the calculation of power with a wattmeter is</p>
                <p>P=VIcosӨ</p>
                <p><strong> Analog wattmeter: </strong></p>
                <p>
                    The traditional analog wattmeter is an electro dynamic instrument. The device consists of a pair of
                    fixed coils, known as current coil and a movable coil known as the potential coil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current coil are connected in series with the circuit, while the potential coil is connected in
                    parallel. Also, on analog wattmeter, the potential coil carries a needle that moves over a scale to
                    indicate the measurement. A current flowing through the current coil generates an electromagnetic
                    field around the coil.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Digital wattmeter: </strong></p>
                <p>
                    A modern digital wattmeter samples the voltage and current thousands of times a second. For each
                    sample, the voltage is multiplied by the current at the same instant; the average over at least one
                    cycle is the real power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The real power divided by the apparent volt-amperes (VA) is the power factor. A computer circuit
                    uses the sampled values to calculate RMS voltage, RMS current, VA, power (watts), power factor, and
                    kilowatt-hours. The readings may be displayed on the device, retained to provide a log and calculate
                    averages, or transmitted to other equipment for further use.
                </p>
                <p>There are various type of wattmeter.</p>
