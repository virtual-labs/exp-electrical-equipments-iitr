                <p>Electric motor, any of a class of devices that convert electrical
                    energy to mechanical energy, usually by employing electromagnetic
                    phenomena.</p>
                <p>Most electric motors develop their mechanical torque by the
                    interaction of conductors carrying in a direction at right angles to a
                    magnetic field. They operate using principle of electromagnetism, which
                    shows that a force is applied when an electric current is present in a
                    magnetic field. This force creates a torque on a loop of wire present in
                    the magnetic field, which causes the motor to spin and perform useful
                    work. Motors are used in a wide range of applications such as fans,
                    power tools, appliances, electric vehicles and hybrid cars. Motors can
                    run both on DC or AC supply.</p>

                        <strong>Induction motor:</strong>
                        <p>An induction motor is a generally used AC electric motor. In an induction motor, the electric
                            current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained via electromagnetic induction from
                            the rotating magnetic field of the stator winding. The rotor of an induction motor can be a
                            squirrel cage rotor or wound type rotor.</p>
                        <p>Used in different applications, induction motors are also called Asynchronous Motors. This is
                            because an induction motor always runs at a slower speed than synchronous speed. The speed
                            of the rotating magnetic field in the stator is called synchronous speed.</p>
                        <p>Induction machines are the most frequently-used type of motor used in residential,
                            commercial, and industrial settings so far. </p>

                        <strong>DC motors:</strong>
                        <p>
                            A DC motor is an electric motor that runs on direct current power. In an electric motor, the
                            operation is dependent upon simple electromagnetism. A current-carrying conductor generates
                            a magnetic field, when this is then placed in an external magnetic field, it will encounter
                            a force proportional to the current in the conductor and to the strength of the external
                            magnetic field. It is a device that converts electrical energy to mechanical energy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It works on the fact that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field
                            experiences a force that causes it to rotate with respect to its original position.
                            Practical DC Motor consists of field windings to provide the magnetic flux and armature
                            which acts as the conductor.

                        <strong>Synchronous motor:</strong>
                        <p>
                            A synchronous motor is an AC motor in which the rotation of the shaft is the same pace as
                            the frequency of the applied current. In other words, the way a synchronous motor works is
                            the same as an AC motor does but with the difference that the total number of rotations made
                            by the shaft in synchronous kind is equal to the integer multiple of the frequency of the
                            applied current.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The synchronous motor doesn’t depend on induction current for its working. In this kind of
                            motor, and unlike the induction motors, there are multiphase AC electromagnets on the stator
                            that produce a rotating magnetic field. In synchronous, the rotor consists of a permanent
                            magnet that is synced with the rotating magnetic field and rotates in synchronous to the
                            frequency of current applied to it.

                        <p>
                            A universal motor is a special type of motor which is designed to run on either DC or single
                            phase AC supply. These motors are generally series wound (armature and field winding are in
                            series), and hence produce high starting torque (See characteristics of DC motors here).
                            That is why, universal motors generally comes built into the device they are meant to drive.
                            Most of the universal motors are designed to operate at higher speeds, exceeding 3500 RPM.
                            They run at lower speed on AC supply than they run on DC supply of same voltage, due to the
                            reactance voltage drop which is present in AC and not in DC.
